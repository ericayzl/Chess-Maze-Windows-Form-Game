# Chess-Maze-Windows-Form-Game
This is a puzzle game I created using C# and Windows Forms. It uses chess pieces that moves the same as a normal chess game. To win the game, try to move from the top left piece to the bottom right piece. A chess piece can only land on another chess piece (not on an empty tile). Try to solve the three levels that I coded!
